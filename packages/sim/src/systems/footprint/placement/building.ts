 *
 * source-basis: the footprint cells and the body/zone split are the extracted
 * `LogicWalkBlockArea`/`LogicBuildBlockArea` data. Original behavior, unconfirmed in the running game:
 * the test is crossed, a new house's top-level body against other houses' build areas and its build area
 * against their current bodies, so margin rings may overlap. Holding the rings disjoint is a deliberate
 * deviation: under the crossed rule a neighbour's upgrade can grow its body across a door exit, a recessed
 * door can be walled off by a body at the ring edge, and small buildings fit inside a wonder's courtyard,
 * each leaving a door no settler reaches.
