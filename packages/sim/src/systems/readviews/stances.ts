/**
 * The ids are verbatim from `logicdefines.inc` `MILITARY_MODE_{NONE, ATTACK, DEFEND, IGNORE, FLEE}`. The
 * radii and leashes live with the combat engagement (`conflict/engagement.ts`).
 *
 *  - NONE: no assigned mode, treated as IGNORE so a stray value never becomes an aggressor.
 *  - ATTACK: look for an enemy around the unit, walk up to it and fight.
 *  - DEFEND: look for an enemy around the anchor, fight it until it strays too far from the anchor, then
 *    walk back.
 *  - IGNORE: never walk to a fight. A fighter strikes an enemy that stands inside its weapon's reach and
 *    lets it go once it strays too far from the anchor; a civilian never fights. An explicit attack order
 *    still works.
 *  - FLEE: accepted as a valid mode but given no behaviour of its own, so it acts as IGNORE. Original
 *    behavior: no one runs at the mere sight of an enemy; the runs come from blows alone.
 *
 * Whoever is not a fighter runs from a blow on itself or beside it under IGNORE and FLEE alike; only ATTACK
 * or DEFEND set on it keeps it standing (`conflict/flee.ts`).
